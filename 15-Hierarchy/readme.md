# Hierarchies

Hierarchies are a core feature of data structures. You see these in all parts of computer science. In the last example, you created a hierarchy with a single level. It was all about cities. Imagine we also want to show a relationship between cities and countries. 

Todo this you can group cities into a larger circle representing the country. The result might look like this. 

![example 1](images/example-1.png)

Note! I added another city to each country for this example. 

If you havn't already read about circular packing read this: https://www.data-to-viz.com/graph/circularpacking.html

## Getting started

For this example, you'll use the `cities.csv` again.

**Challenge**

Create a new HTML file with an `SVG` element. 

Import the D3.js library from the CDN. 

Add a script tag for your code. 

Load the cities.csv data using the `d3.csv()` loader. 

## Visualizing hierarchies

Looking at the cities data you'll find there is a hierarchy hidden in there. Cities all belong to a country. This data structure is flat and doesn't express that hierarchy.

The original data look slike this: 

- "label","population","country","x","y"
- "San Francisco",874961,"USA",122,-37
- "Fresno",525010,"USA",119,-36
- "Lahore",11126285,"Pakistan",74,31
- "Karachi",14910352,"Pakistan",67,24
- "Rome",4342212,"Italy",12,41
- "Naples",967069,"Italy",14,40
- "Rio",6748000,"Brazil",-43,-22
- "Sao Paolo",12300000,"Brazil",-46,-23

Expressed as a single array: 

```JS
[
  { label: "San Francisco", population: 874961, country: "USA", x: 122, y: -37
  { label: "Fresno", population: 525010, country: "USA", x: 119, y: -36
  { label: "Lahore", population: 11126285, country: "Pakistan", x: 74, y: 31
  { label: "Karachi", population: 14910352, country: "Pakistan", x: 67, y: 24
  { label: "Rome", population: 4342212, country: "Italy", x: 12, y: 41
  { label: "Naples", population: 967069, country: "Italy", x: 14, y: 40
  { label: "Rio", population: 6748000, country: "Brazil", x: -43, y: -22
  { label: "Sao Paolo", population: 12300000, country: "Brazil", x: -46, y: -23
]
```

Notice some cities share a country. This adds a level of hierarchy to the data, not expressed in the data structure. 

We could rearrange the data to express the hierarchy like this: 

```JS
{ 
  Brazil: [
    {label: "Rio", population: "6748000", country: "Brazil", x: "-43", y: "-22"},
    {label: "Sao Paolo", population: "12300000", country: "Brazil", x: "-46", y: "-23"}
  ],
  Italy: [
    {label: "Rome", population: "4342212", country: "Italy", x: "12", y: "41"},
    {label: "Naples", population: "967069", country: "Italy", x: "14", y: "40"}
  ],
  Pakistan: [
    {label: "Lahore", population: "11126285", country: "Pakistan", x: "74", y: "31"},
    {label: "Karachi", population: "14910352", country: "Pakistan", x: "67", y: "24"}
  ],
  USA: [
    {label: "San Francisco", population: "874961", country: "USA", x: "122", y: "-37"},
    {label: "Fresno", population: "525010", country: "USA", x: "119", y: "-36"}
  ]
}
```

With this arrangement, we can see that each country has cities. With this struture your code can make sense of the hierarchy! 

## D3 Hierarchies

For D3 to understand the hierarchy you have created you need to arrange the data in a form that D3 will recognize. 

Every property needs to have a `children` property that contains the children of that node. 

In the last example you needed to arrange your data as:

```JS
{ 
  children: [
    { label: 'Fresno', ... }, 
    { label: 'Lahore', ... }, 
    { label: 'Rome', ... }, 
    ...
  ] 
}
```

This is one level deep with the top-level having a single `children` property. 

For this example you need to arrange the data like this: 

```JS
{ 
  label: 'World',
  population: 9999999,
  children: []
}
```

Note! The population needs to be the total population of all child cities! 

This will be the root element of the hierarchy.

**Challenge** 

Define an object with `label`, `population`, and `children` properties. Make sure the value for `population` is the total population of all cities.

Calculate the total population from the original data.

<details>
<summary>

**solution**

</summary>

```JS
const byCountry = {
  label: 'world',
  children: [],
  population: data.reduce((acc, d) => parseInt(d.population) + acc, 0)
}
```

</details>

## Creating a hierarchy

Your next challenge is to rearrange the data into a hierarchy. To do this, you need to arrange the data so that D3 will recognize our hierarchy. 

At the top level you need: 

```JS
{
  name: 'root',
  children: [ ... ]
}
```

`root` is the parent and `children` is an array of children or child objects. 

The `children` array should contain an array of objects each with a `name` and `children`, and again `children` is an array of objects. 

```JS
{
  name: 'root',
  children: [
    { name: 'USA', population: 1825068, children: [ ... ] },
    { name: 'Pakistan', population: 28006679, children: [ ... ] },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Do you see where this going? The array of `children` in each country contains the cities in that country! If each **city** was broken into **counties** the city object would store it's counties in an array in the `children` property! 

The goal is to get the data to look like this: 

```JS
{
  name: 'root',
  children: [
    { 
      name: 'USA', 
      population: 1825068,
      children: [
        { label: "San Francisco", population: 874961, x: 122, y -37 }, 
        { label: "Fresno", population: 525010, x: 119, y: -36 }
      ] 
    },
    { 
      name: 'Pakistan', 
      population: 28006679,
      children: [
        { label: "Lahore", population: 11126285, x: 74, y 31 },
        { label: "Karachi", population: 14910352, x: 67, y: 24 }
      ] 
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

Note! you have to sum the population for all cities in a country along the way. You did this earlier, it's not shown in the last couple examples!

**Challenge**

Your goal is to get the data arranged in the structure above. There are many ways to do this. Any method you choose is as good as another. 

If you need help getting started try this. Start with:

```JS
const byCountry = {
  name: 'root',
  children: []
}
```

From here you need to populate the children with a list of countries. Where each country has a name and an array of children. Get the countries first with a map. You'll end up with duplicates so you can remove these by making a set:

```JS
const countryNames = Array.from(new Set(data.map(d => d.country)))
```

This should give you an array of unique country names/strings. Now turn these into objects with children.

Along the way you need to sum the total population of each country and assign that to each country object! The world has the population of all cities in the world, and each country should have a population that is the total population of all cities in that country! 

<details>
<summary>

**Solution**

</summary>

```JS
const countryNames = Array.from(new Set(data.map(d => d.country)))
countryNames.forEach(d => {
  const cities = data.filter(c => c.country === d)
  const pop = cities.reduce((acc, d) => parseInt(d.population) + acc, 0)
  byCountry.children.push({ 
    label: d, 
    population: pop, 
    children: cities 
  })
})

console.log(byCountry) 
```

</details>

Once you have solved this your data is ready for D3! Often you will need to "massage" your data into a form that works with the code that you are writing! 

## Creating the hierarchy with D3

Create a D3 hierarchy with: 

```JS
const root = d3.hierarchy(byCountry)
```

Note! `byCountry` was the name I used to store the hierarchy created in the previous step. You may have used any other name, so adjust these examples accordingly! 

Now sum the populations!

```JS
root
  .sum(d => {
  return d.population
}) 
// Must call sum before pack()!
```

## Packing the Circles

Now create a pack from your hierarchy. Note! This code is the same as the previous tutorial example! 

```JS
// Pack - Create a pack function
const pack = d3.pack()
  .size([500, 500]) // Set the size of the area
  .padding(2) // define some padding between each circle
```

Now pack the root node. 

```JS
// Create a root node for d3 to draw
const rootNode = pack(root) // Must call sum() first! 
// This adds new properties to the root data
```

Here you created a pack object from the original data. It helps to understand what happens later if you look at the `rootNode` now. Try logging it to the console. 

```JS
console.log(rootNode)
```

You get something like this: 

```JS
pd {data: Object, height: 2, depth: 0, parent: null, children: Array, â€¦}
```

Notice the original data has been rearranged and new properties have been added. 

Let's open this up and explore. 

```js
{
  children: [pd, pd, pd, pd],
  data: {label: "world", children: Array, population: 57334411},
  depth: 0,
  height: 2,
  parent: null,
  r: 249.99999999999997,
  value: 172003233,
  x: 250,
  y: 250
}
```

Notice your original object, with properties properties: `label`, `children`, and `population` has been moved to live under the `data` property. 

New properties have been. Added: `x`, `y`, and `r` are used to position and size this circle. You will use these to position and size your SVG elements. 

The `depth`, `parent`, and `children` are used by D3 to manage the hierarchy. 

Now you have a structure that relates the parent element to its children and the child to the parent, and all these to the SVG elements that will be displayed! 

## Creating formtters and scales

Make a number formatter and a color scale. 

```JS
// Number formatter
const num_f = d3.format(".2s")

// Create a color scale
const colorScale = d3
  .scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10)
```

This the number formatter from the previous tutorial. 

The color scale is ordinal with the `schemeCategory10` which provides 10 different colors. The ordinal scale will allow us to map any arbitrary value across these 10 colors. In this case, we can use the country name or the city name, or even the population.

Note! You could use a list of your own colors here. For example: 

```JS
// Create a color scale 
const colorScale = d3
  .scaleOrdinal(['gold', 'tomato', 'cornflowerblue', 'green', 'chocolate', 'cadetblue', 'rebeccapurple'])
```

Here the scale values are a list of keyword colors. You can use any color values here, or one of D3's built in color scales, which you worked with previously! 

## Drawing the Circles

Draw the circles. This is the same as the previous tutorial! 

```JS
// Start drawing circles! 
const nodes = d3.select('#svg')
  .selectAll('g')
  .data(rootNode.descendants())
  .join('g')
  .attr('transform', d => `translate(${d.x}, ${d.y})`)
```

Here you're drawing the groups that will eventually hold the circles and text. 

This returns a list of group nodes which you will use to add some circles and text. 

Let's draw some circles. The cities will be positioned within a country, and countries will all be positioned within the world.

Notice that each circle is transformed and the `x` and `y` values that were created when we "packed" our data. 

You'll be adding a circle and text to each of these groups in the next steps. These elements will inherit the position from their group. 

```JS
nodes
  .append('circle')
  .attr('r', d => d.r) // get the radius
  .attr('fill', d => {
    if (d.data.country === undefined) {
      return colorScale(d.data.label)
    }
    return colorScale(d.data.country)
  })
  .attr('opacity', '0.5')
```

NOTE! This is iterating over all of the descendents. That is all of the children, and those children's children starting with the root node. Try this: 

```JS
 nodes
  .append('circle')
  .attr('r', d => d.r) // get the radius
  .attr('fill', d => {
    // Try logging the label
    console.log(d.data.label)
    if (d.data.country === undefined) {
      return colorScale(d.data.label)
    }
    return colorScale(d.data.country)
  })
  .attr('opacity', '0.5')
```

In the console you should see a list like this: 

```
world 
USA 
Pakistan 
Italy 
Brazil 
San Francisco 
Fresno 
Lahore
Karachi 
Rome 
Naples 
Rio 
Sao Paol
```

Notice that D3 started with the world, then looped over all of it's children displaying the countries. Then it look at each of those children and looped over those children, this would be the cities!

The radius `r` attribute is set from our `rootNode` where D3 conveniently created the value for us to use. 

```JS
.attr('r', d => d.r) // get the radius
```

The position is not needed since the group was positioned. Being a child of the group an element will inherit the position of the group. 

The fill color is set by the country or label name. D3 is going to iterate through all of the elements in the hierarchy. All of the leaf nodes (the cities) have a country name. The world and country nodes all use the `label` property to store their name. Here you can check if the country is `undefined` and use `label` instead. 

```JS
.attr('fill', d => {
  if (d.data.country === undefined) {
    return colorScale(d.data.label)
  }
  return colorScale(d.data.country)
})
```

Passing the country name into the `colorScale()` should give us a unique color for each country. Since the city nodes will have the same colors as the country that contains them, you passed the country name for that city into the `colorScale()`. 

```JS
.attr('opacity', '0.5')
```

The last line sets the `opacity` of the element. This makes circles 50% transparent. Without this, it would be hard to see the cities contained within the country circles. 

**Challenge** Give countries and cities a different opacity. Imagine countries are more transparent with an opacity of `0.2`. Cities are less opaque with and have an opactity of 0.5. Look at the `.attr('fill', ...)` for ideas on how to solve this! 

At this point your visualization might look like this: 

![example 2](images/example-2.png)

Note! The image above is using the key word colors `.scaleOrdinal(['gold', 'tomato', 'cornflowerblue', 'green', 'chocolate', 'cadetblue', 'rebeccapurple'])`. If you used different colors your results might look different. 

![example 3](images/example-3.png)

This example uses the `.scaleOrdinal(d3.schemeCategory10)` color list. 

**Challenge**

Play with the values and properties to change the appearance. Try these ideas: 

- Try giving the countries a stroke
- Try removing the fill from the world and giving the world only a stroke

Here are a few images showing what these modifications might look like. 

![example 4](images/example-4.png)

Country and world opacity `0.15`, opacity of cities is `0.5`.

![example 5](images/example-5.png)

Here all of the circles have a `stroke` of `black` and a `stroke-width` of 1. Notice the opacity affects the stroke! 

## Adding the text

Adding text is the last step. Here you will display the population to each city. There are a few problems to solve. 

The size of some of the circles is pretty small. The numbers may be larger than the diameter. Adding the city or country name will most likely extend beyond the area of the circle that contains it in some cases. 

Second, the child circles appear on top of their parents. This will cover elements in the parent. For example, the countries appear on top of the world, and the cities appear on top of the countries. In some cases this is good, for example, this works well to display the circles. For labels this might not work so well. 

Add the population to each circle: 

```JS
nodes
  .append('text')
  .text(d => `${num_f(d.data.population)}`)
  .attr('font-family', 'Helvetica')
  .style('text-anchor', 'middle')
  .style('alignment-baseline', 'middle')
  .style('fill', 'white')
```

Here you append a text node to each group in nodes. 

```JS
nodes
	.append('text')
```

Set the text to population, and use the number formatter to format the numbers. 

```JS
.text(d => `${num_f(d.data.population)}`)
```

Then set some text attributes and styles. These include the `font-family`, `text-anchor`, and `alignment-baseline`, and `fill`. 

```JS
.attr('font-family', 'Helvetica')
.style('text-anchor', 'middle')
.style('alignment-baseline', 'middle')
.style('fill', 'white')
```

The `text-anchor` and `alignment-baseline` set the center point around where the text will be drawn, `text-anchor` `middle` sets the position to horizontal center. The `alignment-baseline` `middle` sets the vertical alignment to the center. 

Might look like this:

![example 6](images/example-6.png)

You can see the country and world populations are covered by the city circles. Also, when the circles are clustered the country population is especially obscured. 

How you deal with this is up to you. Here are a few ideas. 

- Move the values so they "stack" in front of the circles.
- Move the values outside of the circles.
- Move the values outside the world circle.
- Create a legend where these values are listed. 

Imagine you wanted to add the city and country names. You can move them above or below the population number. SVG doesn't allow for a text wrap or line break. The best we can do is make a second text element but this will require moving the two elements so that they do not overlap. 

Add a new text element to display the name. 

```JS
nodes
  .append('text')
  .text(d => `${d.data.label}`)
  .attr('font-family', 'Helvetica')
  .style('text-anchor', 'middle')
  .style('alignment-baseline', 'middle')
  .style('fill', 'white')
```

With this addition things might look like this: 

![example 7](images/example-7.png)

You can see the names are centered on top of the population numbers. You can nudge one of these up and the other down so they don't overlap. 

Remember you have two blocks that each add a text node. One for the population and the other for the name. 

Nudge the population number down by adding the following line to its block: 

```JS
.attr('transform', `translate(0, 8)`)
```

Then nudge the name up by adding this to the end of the other block: 

```JS
.attr('transform', `translate(0, -8)`)
```

With transform, the first value is the offset on the x or horizontal axis and the second number is the offset on the y or vertical axis. The numbers `8` and `-8` were chosen arbitrarily. You can adjust these to the font size and your visual taste. 

It might look like this so far: 

![example 8](images/example-8.png)

Note this is imperfect especially in the USA since all of the circles are much smaller than the text. 

To make this work you will have to make more changes.

- If the whole diagram is larger then there will be more space and the centers of all of the circles will move further apart. 
- The text could be smaller. This would provide more space. If the text is too small it will be hard to read. 
- You can move them off the center of their circles. 

To wrap up this tutorial section let's experiment with the last idea. 

For the country names block I made these changes: 

```JS
nodes
  .append('text')
  .text(d => `${d.data.label}`)
  .attr('font-family', 'Helvetica')
  .style('text-anchor', 'middle')
  .style('alignment-baseline', 'middle')
  // set the fill color to black for country and world
  .style('fill', d => {
    if (d.data.country === undefined) {
      return 'black'
    }
    return 'white'
  })
  // Offset the y by the radius for the country and world
  .attr('transform', d => {
    if (d.data.country === undefined) {
      return `translate(0, -${d.r})`
    }
  
    return 'translate(0, -8)'
  })
```

Here you check that it is not a city node and then make some changes. 

I changed the color to black for the countries and world. 

Then I offset the y position by the radius. This moves the text to the top of the circle. This has the problem where the world label is halfway off the top of the SVG. I made the SVG larger by 20 and offset the group nodes by 10 to compensate. 

Here is what my example looked like: 

![example 9](images/example-9.png)

Still imperfect but hopefully you can see some options that might help make a better visualization. 

## Conclusion

In this tutorial you delved into hierarchies and packs. This is a fairly complex visualization that makes use of tree structures. 

This is a circle pack, read more about this here: https://datavizproject.com/data-type/packed-circle-chart/
